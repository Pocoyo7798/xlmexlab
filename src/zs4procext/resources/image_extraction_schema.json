    "initialization": "Each marker in the graph represents a data point. Ensure all visible data points are counted and included.\nIf any points are ambiguous, occluded, or unclear, mark their values as 'N/A'.\nDo not alter or simplify any axis or series labels â€” copy them exactly as written in the image or figure."

  "conclusion": "Do not summarize or modify labels or series names. They must be copied exactly as presented, converting only superscripts and subscripts to plain numbers/text. If you're unsure about any data point, mark it as 'N/A'."
