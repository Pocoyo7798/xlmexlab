    "description": "Each marker in the graph represents a data point. Ensure all visible data points are counted and included.\n If any points are ambiguous, occluded, or unclear, mark their values as 'N/A'.\n Do not alter or simplify any axis or series labels â€” copy them exactly as written in the image or figure."
